Suboptimal and costly algorithms, such as classical or sequential beamforming, are required to initialize a local search that eventually furnishes DOA estimates. This multistage process may be nonrobust in the presence of even small errors in prior guesses about angles and number of sources generated by inherent limitations of the preprocessing and may lead to catastrophic errors in practical applications. A new approach to wideband direction finding is introduced and described. The proposed strategy combines a robust near-optimal data-adaptive statistic, called the weighted average of signal subspaces (WAVES), with an enhanced design of focusing matrices to ensure a statistically robust preprocessing of wideband data. The overall sensitivity of WAVES to various error sources, such as imperfect array focusing, is also reduced with respect to traditional CSSM algorithms, as demonstrated by extensive Monte Carlo simulations.},

TOPS can be used with arbitrary shaped one-dimensional (1-D) or two-dimensional (2-D) arrays. Unlike other coherent wideband methods, such as the coherent signal subspace method (CSSM) and WAVES, the new method does not require any preprocessing for initial values. The performance of those wideband techniques and incoherent MUSIC is compared with that of the new method through computer simulations. The simulations show that this new technique performs better than others in mid signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges, while coherent methods work best in low SNR and incoherent methods work best in high SNR.

It uses SRP-PHAT power maps as input features of a fully convolutional causal architecture that uses 3D convolutional layers to accurately perform the tracking of a sound source even in highly reverberant scenarios where most of the state of the art techniques fail. Unlike previous methods, since we do not use bidirectional recurrent layers and all our convolutional layers are causal in the time dimension, our system is feasible for real-time applications and it provides a new DOA estimation for each new SRP-PHAT map. To train the model, we introduce a new procedure to simulate random trajectories as they are needed during the training, equivalent to an infinite-size dataset with high flexibility to modify its acoustical conditions such as the reverberation time. We use both acoustical simulations on a large range of reverberation times and the actual recordings of the LOCATA dataset to prove the robustness of our system and its good performance even using low-resolution SRP-PHAT maps.},

	abstract = {Traditional active noise control (ANC) methods are based on adaptive signal processing with the least mean square algorithm as the foundation. They are linear systems and do not perform satisfactorily in the presence of nonlinear distortions. In this paper, we formulate ANC as a supervised learning problem and propose a deep learning approach, called deep ANC, to address the nonlinear ANC problem. The main idea is to employ deep learning to encode the optimal control parameters corresponding to different noises and environments. A convolutional recurrent network (CRN) is trained to estimate the real and imaginary spectrograms of the canceling signal from the reference signal so that the corresponding anti-noise can eliminate or attenuate the primary noise in the ANC system. Large-scale multi-condition training is employed to achieve good generalization and robustness against a variety of noises. The deep ANC method can be trained to achieve active noise cancellation no matter whether the reference signal is noise or noisy speech. In addition, a delay-compensated strategy is introduced to solve the potential latency problem of ANC systems. Experimental results show that deep ANC is effective for wideband noise reduction and generalizes well to untrained noises. Moreover, the proposed method can achieve ANC within a quiet zone and is robust against variations in reference signals.},

The new L element structure uses the BSS as a front-end processor to extract the target signal spatially from the interference (noise and echo). Statistical measures are then employed to select the target signal dominant signal from the BSS outputs. The remaining L-1 BSS outputs (noise and echo dominant) and the existing far-end line echo are then used as the reference signals in an adaptive noise canceller (ANC) to enhance the target signal temporally. The novel structure bypasses the need for any a priori information whilst compensating the separation quality of the BSS temporally. Real room evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the scheme in both noisy double-talk and non double-talk situations.},

In particular, when the impulse responses are long, performance is highly limited. In this paper, we consider a two-input, two-output convolutive BSS problem. First, we show that it is not good to be constrained by the condition T{\textgreater}P, where T is the frame length of the DFT and P is the length of the room impulse responses. We show that there is an optimum frame size that is determined by the trade-off between maintaining the number of samples in each frequency bin to estimate statistics and covering the whole reverberation. We also clarify the reason for the poor performance of BSS in long reverberant environments, highlighting that the framework of BSS works as two sets of frequency-domain adaptive beamformers. Although BSS can reduce reverberant sounds to some extent like adaptive beamformers, they mainly remove the sounds from the jammer direction. This is the reason for the difficulty of BSS in reverberant environments.},

However, frequency-domain BSS involves a permutation problem: the permutation ambiguity of ICA in each frequency bin should be aligned so that a separated signal in the time-domain contains frequency components of the same source signal. This paper presents a robust and precise method for solving the permutation problem. It is based on two approaches: direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for sources and the interfrequency correlation of signal envelopes. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches, and integrate them to exploit their respective advantages. Furthermore, by utilizing the harmonics of signals, we make the new method robust even for low frequencies where DOA estimation is inaccurate. We also present a new closed-form formula for estimating DOAs from a separation matrix obtained by ICA. Experimental results show that our method provided an almost perfect solution to the permutation problem for a case where two sources were mixed in a room whose reverberation time was 300 ms.},

Changing cross correlations at multiple times give a sufficient set of constraints for the unknown channels. A least squares optimization allows us to estimate a forward model, identifying thus the multipath channel. In the same manner we can find an FIR backward model, which generates well separated model sources. Furthermore, for more than three channels we have sufficient conditions to estimate underlying additive sensor noise powers.

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to solve for the challenging problem of acoustic Room Impulse Response estimation (RIR). The approach formulates the RIR estimation as a Blind Channel Identification (BCI) problem and it exploits sparsity and non-negativity priors to reduce illposedness and to increase robustness of the solution to noise. This provides an iterative procedure based on a reweighted l1-norm penalty and a standard l1-norm constraint. The proposed method guarantees the convexity of the problem at each iteration, it avoids drawbacks related to anchor constraints and it enforces sparsity in a more effective way with respect to standard l1-norm penalty approaches. Experiments show that our approach outperform current state of the art methods on speech and non-speech real signals.},

	abstract = {The speech transmission index (STI) and room-acoustic parameters, such as the reverberation time and clarity index, are essential to assess the quality of room acoustics. However, in everyday spaces occupied by people, it is difficult to obtain such parameters since the room impulse response (RIR) cannot be measured. Blind estimation of room acoustic parameters from observed signals without measuring RIR is therefore necessary. Although existing methods can estimate one of these parameters, a single parameter is inadequate to describe comprehensive subjective aspects. To this end, this paper proposes a method for estimating STI and five room-acoustic parameters simultaneously. The temporal amplitude envelope of a reverberant speech signal is mapped to the parameters of an RIR model for each sub-band. Instead of using Schroeder{\textquoteright}s RIR model, the extended RIR model is used to approximate an unknown RIR so that the STI and room-acoustic parameters can be derived. We performed simulations to evaluate the proposed method in unseen reverberant environments. The root-mean-square errors between the ground-truths and estimated parameters suggest that the accuracy of the proposed scheme outperformed that with Schroeder{\textquoteright}s RIR model and was close to the standard measurements.},
