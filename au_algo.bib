	abstract = {The minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer is a classical filter to reduce the interference plus noise energy without distorting the desired signal. Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a subfield of convex optimization concerned with the optimization of a linear objective function over the intersection of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. In this paper, we will show MVDR objective function can be derived from SDP objective function and vice versa. This conclusion can help students better understand MVDR from convex optimization and bring them a new insight of MVDR theory.},
